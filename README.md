# Recommender-Syetem-Collaborative-Filtering-Theory-
The objective of a Recommender System is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Collaborative Filtering :This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.
